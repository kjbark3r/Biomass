shrub biomass quicknotes

for each species
	-different equation for leaves and stems (sometimes but not always)
	-spreadsheet notes which types of equation and which parameters to use
		- e = exponential -> y = ae^(bx)
		- l = linear -> y = ax + b
		- p = power -> y = ax^(b)
		- m = mean -> y = dunno
	- variables same for all
		- y = biomass (g)
		- x = basal diam (mm)

my next steps
	- create version of spreadsheet that contains these columns:
		- SpeciesCode
		- For both leaves and stems (with unique column names):
			- Function (tells equation type)
			- a
			- b
			- Source (of function)
		- **ADD CHRVIS TO THIS SPREADSHEET (GENERAL E EQN)
	- write R code that relates shrub species to biomass equation
		***trimws() [ARTTRI has one, not sure which others]
		- make 0s NAs
		- calculate average basal diameter per quadrat per species
			- multiply by #stems in quadrat => total mm in quadrat PER SPECIES
		- 

		- average quadrats to get mm/m in plot
		- join df with eqn df by species
		- 



decisions/misc stuff i did
	- CHRVIS - no equation in spreadsheet. Used general equation because 
	  rabbitbrush is similar to sagebrush, and sagebrush uses general eqn
	- VACCAE - no leaf equation in spreadsheet. Used VACSCO leaf equation 
	  because it looks more similar to VACSCO than VACMEM
